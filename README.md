# Hello there

- My name is Clemens.
- I ...
  - got my BSc in Computer Science @ [UAS Technikum Wien](https://www.technikum-wien.at/en/).
  - currently work as a backend developer.
  - mainly use Java, Go and nodejs for programming, but I'm not afraid to try something new.
  - am also interested in DevOps stuff and have a server at home running NixOS.
  - like to automate all the boring stuff. :)
  - have a [gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/) instance where I keep all my private repos, the code I feel confident/useful enough to share is here on GitHub.
  - use Linux on all my PCs and do all of my editing in neovim and IntelliJ.
  - mostly listen to progressive rock and other slightly weird music. [Here's a great example of what I like :)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFwcahcDzP4)
