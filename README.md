# Hello there

- My name is Clemens.
- I got my BSc in Computer Science @ [UAS Technikum Wien](https://www.technikum-wien.at/en/).
- I work as a backend developer.
- I mainly use Java, Go and nodejs. I'm also interested in Rust and write way too many shell scripts, and I'm not afraid to try something new :)
- I have a [gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/) server where I keep all my private repos, the code I feel confident/interesting enough to make public is here on GitHub.
- I use Linux ([btw](https://archlinux.org/)) and do all of my editing in neovim and IntelliJ.
- I mostly listen to prog rock and metal. [Here's a good example of music I like :)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrDM6V08wcE)
